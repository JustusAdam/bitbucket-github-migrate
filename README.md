# Migrate from Bitbucket to GitHub

This is a utility for moving complete project from the online repository hosting service Bitbucket to GitHub, a similar, yet better, repository hosting service.

This is not the same thing as the GitHub importing tool.

## Status

Very very alpha. So alpha, it does, in fact, not work yet.
